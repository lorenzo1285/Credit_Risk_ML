# Machine Learning Models for Predictive Analytics

This repository contains two main projects focused on predictive analytics using machine learning: Decision Tree classification and Credit Risk modeling.

## Decision Tree Classifier (`Decision_Tree.ipynb`)

### Overview
This notebook demonstrates a practical implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier for categorical outcome predictions, emphasizing interpretability and evaluation.

### Objective
- Train and evaluate a Decision Tree Classifier.
- Analyze feature importance and visualize decision paths.

### Key Libraries
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Model training and evaluation (`DecisionTreeClassifier`).

### Data
- Features dataset (`catg_features2.csv`).
- Target labels (`yhat_catg.csv`).

### Workflow
1. Load and preprocess data.
2. Split into training and testing sets.
3. Train the Decision Tree model.
4. Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Visualize decision tree and interpret results.

## Credit Risk Machine Learning (`Credit_RiskML.ipynb`)

### Overview
This project addresses credit risk assessment using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling.

### Objective
- Conduct exploratory data analysis using comprehensive visualizations.
- Build predictive models to evaluate and classify credit risk.

### Key Libraries
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data management and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization and exploratory analysis.
- **DataPrep**: Advanced exploratory data analysis.

### Data
- Accounts dataset (`ACCOUNTS.csv`).
- Demographics dataset (`DEMOGRAPHICS.csv`).
- Loans dataset (`LOANS.csv`).

### Workflow
1. Import and examine datasets.
2. Conduct detailed exploratory analysis using DataPrep.
3. Preprocess and combine datasets for modeling.
4. Develop and evaluate predictive models for credit risk classification.

## Usage
- Ensure the datasets are correctly placed in the working directory.
- Install necessary libraries as mentioned in each notebook.
- Execute notebook cells sequentially for reproducibility and analysis.

## Applications
These projects can be applied in:
- Risk management and assessment
- Financial modeling and credit scoring
- Customer segmentation
- Predictive analytics
